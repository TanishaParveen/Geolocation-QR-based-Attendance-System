# Geolocation-QR-based-Attendance-System
<br>
Geo-Attend is a secure, geolocation-based QR code attendance system designed to eliminate proxy attendance and improve tracking accuracy in educational institutions. The system leverages time-sensitive QR codes (refreshed every 1.5 minutes), real-time geolocation validation using the Haversine formula, and device fingerprinting to ensure attendance is marked only by authorized students physically present at the designated location. A real-time dashboard offers administrators and faculty insight into attendance logs and trends.

A QR Attendance System enhances efficiency by significantly reducing the time and effort involved in traditional attendance methods such as roll calls or manual registers. Each student scans a dynamically generated QR code, instantly logging their presence along with timestamp, location, and device identity, ensuring high accuracy and preventing misuse.
